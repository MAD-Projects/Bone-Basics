# Development Process


## Continuous Delivery

Continuous delivery (CD) is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time. It aims at building, testing, and releasing software faster and more frequently. The approach helps reduce the cost, time, and risk of delivering changes by allowing for more incremental updates to applications in production. A straightforward and repeatable deployment process is important for continuous delivery. (“Continuous Delivery”)

##Agile

### Agile Definition

Agile is the 12 guiding principles of the Agile Manifesto for producing software. The best developers incorporate the principles in their day to day work. (“How Are DevOps and Agile Different? - Quora”)

### Agile Manifesto

####[Agile Manifesto Principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)  
"We follow these principles:
Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
Working software is the primary measure of progress.
Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
Simplicity-the art of maximizing the amount of work not done-is essential.
The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly." (“Manifesto for Agile Software Development”)

#### [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/)  
"We are uncovering better wasy of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:
- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools.
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation.
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation.
- **Responding to change** over following a plan.

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more." (“Manifesto for Agile Software Development”)



## DevOps

###Dev Ops Definition

DevOps is a term to describes the foundational and operational aspects of producing software (e.g., environment setup, software containers, automated testing, continuous integration, continuous deployment). (“How Are DevOps and Agile Different? - Quora”)

DevOps (a clipped compound of "development" and "operations") is a culture, movement or practice that emphasizes the collaboration and communication of both software developers and other information-technology (IT) professionals while automating the process of software delivery and infrastructure changes. It aims at establishing a culture and environment where building, testing, and releasing software, can happen rapidly, frequently, and more reliably. (“DevOps”)

## The Fifth Discipline

"Engineers say that a new idea has been "invented" when it is proven to work in the laboratory. The idea becomes an "innovation" only when it can be replicated reliably on a meaningful scale at practical costs. " (Senge)


An organization's commitment to and capacity for learning can be no greater than that of its members. (Senge)
